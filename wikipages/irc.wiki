<h2>IRC</h2>
<p>To connect to the <a href="https://tilde.chat">tildeverse IRC network</a> and begin chatting while logged on to tilde.institute, simply use the command <code>chat</code>! If you prefer to use a different IRC client than the default, such as irssi, the following server information will apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>localhost, port 6667</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don't forget to /join #institute and /join #meta</p>
        <p>Join us on the tildeverse IRC network and socialize with other tilde users!</p>
        <p>tilde.institute is now peering with the larger <a href="https://tilde.chat">tildeverse IRC network</a>! Our specific node can be connected remotely via institute.tilde.chat, port 6697, with SSL enabled.</p>
