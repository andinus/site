		<p>Welcome to tilde.institute! This is an OpenBSD machine whose purpose is to provide a space in the <a href="https://tildeverse.org">tildeverse</a> for experimentation with and education of the OpenBSD operating system. A variety of editors, shells, and compilers are installed to allow for development in a native OpenBSD environment. OpenBSD's httpd(8) is configured with slowcgi(8) as the fastcgi provider and sqlite3 available. This allows users to experiment with web development using compiled CGI in C, aka the <a href="https://learnbchs.org">BCHS Stack</a>. In addition to php7.0 and mysql (mariadb) by request, this provides an environment where the development of complex web apps is possible.</p>

            <h1>News &amp; Updates</h1>
            <em>2018 December 16</em>
            <p>I got the IRC peering done. tilde.institute is now a node on the larger tildeverse IRC network. Local IRC configs have been updated en masse and the <a href="irc.html">IRC page</a> has been updated to reflect the new info.</p>
            <em>2018 December 14</em>
            <p>I dun goof'd again on the smtpd.conf syntax. All should be working again. I promise. I really promise this time.</p>
            <em>2018 December 14</em>
            <p>Apparently I dun goof'd and didn't allow smtp traffic in pf (OpenBSD's firewall). So now mail works as it should.</p>
            <em>2018 December 10</em>
            <p>New IRC bot in the works! I named it "skoolbot", it lives in #institute. So far it returns the uptime/load, manpages by search term, and lets you toot to the ~institute mastodon account via IRC.</p>
            <p>I also hacked together a couple of scripts designed to aggregate both connected users and registered users, every 5 minutes and 1 hour respectively, and stitch together the info <a href="/stats">for a stats page</a>.</p>
            <em>2018 December 8</em>
            <p>I installed a collaborative world-building game called <code>holodeck</code>! It runs like a MUD, without the combat. You explore and create areas, describing the areas as you go. It uses a central database, allowing all users of tilde.institute to collaborate on a single world.</p>
            <em>2018 December 5</em>
            <p>Changed up some of the styling on the main site. I also installed a fun game called <code>botany</code> which allows you to grow various plants on the console. Give it a try!</p>
            <em>2018 December 3</em>
            <p>I just installed DokuWiki so users can record and share cool things to do and cool ways to customize their environment, etc. The link is with the other navigation links.</p>
